Automation Configuration
************************

The *Automation Kit* is designed to be intergated into an organizations continuous
integration system.  The automation kit can be configured by using environment variables,
commandline options, and through configuration files.  When the same option is configurable
via more than one of these mechanisms, the automation kit will prioritize the setting
based on precidence.  The precidence which the automation kit uses from lowest to highest
for settings is:

    * Default Configuration
    * Environment Variables
    * Runtime Configuration (file)
    * Commandline Option

So by default if nothing is passed for a setting, the *Automation Kit* will utilize default
settings for the activation mode that is being used.  Activation modes provide a quick way to
spin up various types of automation applications and services.  The activation modes supported are:

    * Command - Command line logging semantics
    * Console - Interactive console
    * Service - Web service and micro-services
    * TestRun - Test Automation run

The Activation modes are discussed in more detail in the
`Activation and Startup <https://github.com/automationmojo/automationkit/blob/main/docs/markdown/51-activation-and-startup.md>`_
section of the documentation.


Default Configuration
=====================
The default configuration for the *Automation Kit* provides easy setup for individual contributors to
help ensure the proficiency of the many individual contributors of the automation organization.  The
default configuration provides generic settings for automation framework behaviors and configuration file
locations.


Environment Variables
=====================

Build Information
-----------------
    AKIT_BUILD_BRANCH = The name of the branch to associate with results. Default is "unknown"
    AKIT_BUILD_FLAVOR = The label for the flavor of the build to associated with the results. Default is "unknown"
    AKIT_BUILD_NAME = The build name or build number to associate with the results."unknown"

Job Runtime Configuration
-------------------------
    AKIT_JOBTYPE = The type of run. "unknown"
    AKIT_RUNID = A guid that is used to uniquely identify and correlate the run results.
    AKIT_SERVICE_NAME = A service name used when the Automation Kit environment is activated as a service.
    AKIT_STARTTIME = The start time to use for correlating results.

    .. note: Job types supported are command, console, testrun, orchestration, service

Logging Configuration
---------------------
    AKIT_LOG_LEVEL_CONSOLE = The maximum logging level to send to the console output.
    AKIT_LOG_LEVEL_FILE = The maximum logging level to send to the primary log file.

    .. note: Logging levels supported are NOTSET, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, QUIET

Debug Options
-------------
    AKIT_BREAKPOINTS = A comma seperated list of wellknown breakpoints.
    AKIT_DEBUGGER = The name of a debug to activate on for the run.
